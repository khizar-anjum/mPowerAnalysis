General Tag:
This data contains mfccs of audio file components of a subset of the voiceAcitivity data.

Naming convention:
X_mfcc.npy: is a general data array name which is a (35130,20,87) size matrix.
35130 represents number of pseudo-patients
20 represents the number of mfcc components
87 represents the time axis
Y.npy is the label of these vector of these arrays which is of size (35130,)

Generation:
This data was generated from AnalysisData. (To read how that went about, read other file)
Following steps were taken to generate it:
1- First I loaded all the analysis data from all of its sections
2- Then I extracted 20 mfcc's from each recording with automatic time resolution using python mfcc library
3- Then it was saved.

Usage:
1- load the X_mfcc data and reshape it according to your algorithm
2- first encode Y into discrete labels (i.e. 0 and 1). It cannot be used in its raw form
