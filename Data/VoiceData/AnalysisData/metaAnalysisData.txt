General Tag:
This data contains the audio file components of a subset of the voiceAcitivity data.

Naming convention:
X_sec(i).npy: is a general data array name which is a 500x44100 matrix in general except when i = 70 and i = 47. 
i goes from 0 to 70.
Y.npy is the label of these vector of these arrays which is of size (35130,)

Generation:
The data given here has been generated from the main audio files of the Voice Activity data.
Following assumptions were taken into account for its generation from the main Voice Activity data:
1- All the recordings in which recorder's (a person) smoking status was true were not included.
2- All the recordings in which recorder's professional diagnosis was unclear were not included.
3- All the recordings in which recorder recorded just after taking a medication were not included.
4- If one person recorded several recordings, all the recordings were treated distinctly and were given separate tags/labels.
5- All the recordings which were corrupt or of invalid sizes or very short (less than 2 seconds) were not included.
6- All the recordings were converted to PCM and subsequently decimated from 44.1 kHz to 4.41 kHz sample rate.
7- All the recordings were of 10s approx, therefore, they were truncated or padded to make them all of 44100 samples. (4.41kHz*10s)
8- They were then packed into bundles of 500 recordings and the recordings were named X_sec(i) where i goes from 0 to 70.
9- i = 47 file contains 499 recordings because it was discovered later that one of its recordings was empty (contained nans)

Usage:
1- The X_sec(i).npy are to be loaded in increasing i fashion and concatenated (vstack) in the same order. This will result in a 
35130x44100 matrix where 44100 is the length of one file and 35130 represents the number of recordings (pseudo-patients to predict)
2- Similarly Y has shape (35130,) and is a boolean vector. True represents positive professional-diagnosis (means it is a patient) and 
false represents healthy.

General Trivia:
X when taken together forms 11.5 GB of data
Out of 35130 recordings, 20250 are labelled positive and 14880 are labeled negative
